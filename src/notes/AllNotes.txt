useEffect()
------------
Side-effect ->  React Server

Component did mount.
useEffect(() =>{
    // logic
},[])

--> Component is fully rendered. After it will execute.
Call will happen when component will fully rendered in Dom.

Suppose sometimes we need to connect with server then 1st component will render in DOM then useEffet() is call at last.

Component will update
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

useEffect(() =>{
    // logic
},[])

Component did un-mount.
useEffect(() =>{
    // logic
    return () =>{
        // logic- when the component is destroyed from DOM
    }
},[])


useState; to hold data we use this
useEffect: to fetch data we use this
